## Information for the summer semester of 2025

## FAQ - pre semester

* If you are on **waiting list** there is *nothing* we can do to enroll you. We managed to master somehow `python`, but SIS is something else. We follow the rules. Students usually drop from the course during the first week of the semester so **there is a good chance** you will be able to register.

* The course is held **in-person** and there is by default **no online** option.

## Course requirements

The requirements for passing the course are homeworks (**5pts**), the midterm (**25pts**), work in-progress-presentation (**10pts**), and the final project - including the final delivery presentation (**60pts**).

At least 50% from the **homeworks assignments** and **work-in-progress** presentation is required for passing the course.

### Final project (60%)

* Students in teams by 2
<!-- * Submit your proposal here [TBA] -->
* [Submit you proposal here](https://forms.gle/Lo1c2YxTQkwewRuL7)
* Deadline for topic submission (week to consult): 22nd of April 2025
* Deadline to attend the WiP consultation: 6th of June 2025
* Deadline for completed project: 16th of June 2025 (possibly in September - not prefered)

#### Projects' Evaluation criteria

* Use of git by both students - 5pts
  * meaningful commit messages
* Pythonic code principles - 5 pts
  * Provide requirements.txt file of the dependencies with versions (can use pip freeze) so that we can install with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
  * code is more often read than written, EAFP (Easier to Ask for Forgiveness than Permission)
* Runnable code - 10 pts
  * by far the most important one! The project needs to run from scratch after installing versioned requirements.
* Code structure - 15 pts
  * functions (classes), properly named variables
* README, documentation - 5 pts
* Analysis, visualization - 15 pts
  * highlight key points of your project, give it some narrative
* Difficulty choice - 5 pts
  * this criteria is subjective and is dependent entirely on your skill
  * the goal is to challenge yourselves and learn something new, regardless if you're a Python novice or you write python code every week

## Project work - presentation (10%)

* Presentation of work-in-progress related to the final project.
* Prepare questions, understand the goals of your project

## Midterm exam (25%)

* Live coding (80 minutes), "open browser", no collaboration between the students.
* No artificial intelligence
* More details during the lecture the week before

## Homework Assignments (5%)

* Create [leetcode.com](https://leetcode.com) account
* You are expected to submit in a specified [Google form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYoxy7uZpZAoCRjT4FdWfCy3KWZUT36AviUB_ms-hbtrplRQ/viewform?usp=sharing) (please make sure to use your Charles University email address, xxxxxxxx@fsv.cuni.cz):
  * Link to the problem
  * Print page showing your solution and submission statistics
    * Like this: [Path Sum III - Submission Detail - LeetCode.pdf](/99_files/PathSumIII-SubmissionDetail-LeetCode.pdf)
    * **EDIT:** You can access the **statistics** of your **solution** (even it is not accepted by *leetcode*) via the top right button to your `profile`. You go to your `submissions`, then column `status` and you obtain the `solution details`. These details you save/print to `.PDF` and upload. **Your `name` or `e-mail` must be legible in the PDF of your submission**
  * Plain text of your script (in python 3!)

* Rules:
  * Do not just copy the public solutions or what ChatGPT tells you. We will make an effort to find out and you will be penalized as per academic integrity guidelines. Do not try to get easy points by cheating, it is not the purpose of the HW tasks.
    * Have fun and try to beat the world!
    * Your submission will ideally be accepted by leetcode, but send us your best attempt regardless, you can still get the points. If anything, try to optimize run time, do not worry about memory.
    * You will struggle, but if you solve many of those, your next stop is Google cafeteria as an employee!
    * If you cannot decide, there is a shuffle button which will pick something for you.

* HW 1 (1 pts):
  * Choose one of the easy problems. Have fun and send us how far you have got!
    * Example: [Two Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/)
* HW 2 (2 pts):
  * One easy or one Medium problem
    * Example: Medium: [Parentheses](https://leetcode.com/problems/generate-parentheses/)
* HW 3 (2 pts):
  * One easy or one Medium problem
  * Must be from [Pandas set of problems](https://leetcode.com/problemset/pandas/)
